      <h2>History</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Following the collapse of MG Rover in 2005, the Chinese automaker Nanjing Automobile acquired the Longbridge plant and the MG marque for £53 million ($97 million).Nanjing Automobile formally established NAC MG UK Limited as a holding company for the plant and marque on 12 April 2006. In March 2007, Nanjing Automobile unveiled the first MG vehicles manufactured in China, the MG TF, MG 3 and MG 7.

Assembly of cars restarted at Longbridge in August 2007, with production of the MG TF LE500.

In 2007, Nanjing Automobile was acquired by SAIC Motor, and in early 2009 NAC MG UK Limited was renamed MG Motor UK Limited.

The first all-new MG-branded model for 16 years, the MG6, was officially launched on 26 June 2011 during a visit to MG Motor's Longbridge plant by Chinese premier Wen Jiabao.

By March 2012, SAIC had invested a total of £450 million in MG Motor Sales in the UK totalled 782 vehicles in 2012.

The MG3 went on sale in the United Kingdom in September 2013

MG Motor was voted third place for the 'Best Manufacturer' category in the Auto Express 2014 Driver Power survey. 2014 also saw MG Motor celebrate the MG brand's 90th birthday. They enjoyed further celebrations with a record-breaking year that saw the company lead UK car industry growth in 2014. The brand's sales rose by 361% during 2014 part thanks to the introduction of the MG3 to the product range,[15] with a total of 2,326 cars sold in the UK.

During 2014, MG was the fastest-growing brand in Britain as shown by official figures issued by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Currently, MG Motor has the fastest-growing network of dealers in the UK.

On 23 September 2016 MG Motor announced that all car production had ceased at Longbridge and henceforth MG vehicles would be imported into the UK.

in 2018, SAIC Design opened a new advanced design studio in London, which deals with the advanced design of MG and Roewe vehicles.

In May 2019, the company unveiled a badge engineered version of Baojun 530 SUV as MG Hecto</p>

      <h2>Production</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Production
After MG Rover collapsed, Nanjing Automobile continued production at the Longbridge plant. Nanjing used Longbridge to produce the MG TF, which they mildly redeveloped.

SAIC took ownership of the MG brand, and from 2010 onwards, the newly released MG 6 was produced in China. However, from 13 April 2011, MG Motor produced the MG 6 at Longbridge.[25] From 2013, the MG 3 also saw some limited final assembly at the same factory.

Activity at Longbridge was gradually reduced. It was announced in September 2016, that production at the Longbridge facility was to be stopped in 2016 and moved to China, with Matthew Cheyne, head of sales and marketing at MG Motor UK citing "moving production abroad was a necessary business decision". Twenty-five employees were made redundant as a result of the move and other employees moved to different areas. It marked the end of MG production in the UK. and production was fully moved to China, with a later factory in Thailand.

In 2019, MG Motor is set to open a fourth factory in China, The factory will be in Ningde, Fujian Province. The factory will specialise in producing electric vehicles, with the new all-electric production sports car being produced at the factory. MG and Roewe's upcoming SUV, codenamed IS 32 (MG) and IS 31 (Roewe) are also set to be produced at the factory.</p>
